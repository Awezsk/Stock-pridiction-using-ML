## Introduction

Predicting stock market prices is a challenging task due to the volatile and dynamic nature of financial markets. This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Tesla, Inc. using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to develop a reliable model that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing historical stock data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing trends, patterns, and key statistics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Training multiple machine learning models to predict stock prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the accuracy and performance of each model.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing stock price trends and prediction results.

## Data

The data used in this project includes historical stock prices for Tesla, Inc. The dataset contains daily stock prices with attributes such as:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

## Model

Several machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated in this project, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Awezsk/Stock-pridiction-using-ML.git
    cd tesla-stock-prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the data**:
    Ensure you have the historical stock data for Tesla. You can download it from sources like Yahoo Finance and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage

To run the model and make predictions, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the data**:
    ```sh
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```

2. **Train the model**:
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Make predictions**:
    ```sh
    python predict.py
    ```

4. **Visualize the results**:
    ```sh
    python visualize_results.py
    ```

## Results

The results of the prediction model are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The visualization scripts provide graphs comparing the predicted stock prices with the actual prices.
